Bumps shakes up {Cucumber}[http://cukes.info] by allowing you to pull feature content and push run results to and from a remote server. This means that your feature files no longer need to live with your steps and other code. This also means that you can publish the results of a Cucumber run to another system.

See the {wiki}[http://wiki.github.com/brentsnook/bumps] for more details.

== Installation

  sudo gem install bumps

=== Building the Gem yourself

Grab the code from github:

  git clone git://github.com/brentsnook/bumps.git
  cd bumps
  rake install_gem

== How do I use it?

First, start up a server that meets the {push/pull contract}[http://wiki.github.com/brentsnook/bumps/push-pull-contract].

Secondly, bung this inside of your *env.rb* (or equivalent, just make sure it is under the feature directory):

  require 'bumps'
  Bumps.configure { use_server 'http://mycompliantserver.com' }

Lastly, just run Cukes as normal.

  cucumber my_feature_directory

Bumps will pull feature files into the specified feature directory, run cukes and then push the results back to the server.
