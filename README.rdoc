== Description

Remote feature management for Cucumber.

Bumps extends {Cucumber}[http://cukes.info] by allowing you to pull feature content and push run results to and from a remote server. This means that your feature files no longer need to live with your steps and other code. This also means that you can publish the results of a Cucumber run to another system.

Bumps has been designed to work with {Bumpybot}[http://github.com/brentsnook/bumpybot] (a Google Wave robot) but it can be used with any server that meets the {push/pull contract}[http://wiki.github.com/brentsnook/bumps/push-pull-contract].

See the {wiki}[http://wiki.github.com/brentsnook/bumps] for more details.

== Installation

  sudo gem install bumps

Or grab the code from Github and build yourself:

  git clone git://github.com/brentsnook/bumps.git
  cd bumps
  rake install_gem

== Synopsis

To use with Bumpybot, {see the directions}[http://github.com/brentsnook/bumpybot].

You can also use Bumps with any other compliant server.

First, start up a server that meets the {push/pull contract}[http://wiki.github.com/brentsnook/bumps/push-pull-contract].

Secondly, bung this inside of your <b>support/env.rb</b> (or equivalent, just make sure it is under a directory named <b>support</b> under the feature directory):

  require 'bumps'
  Bumps.configure { use_server 'http://mycompliantserver.com' }

Lastly, just run Cukes as normal.

  cucumber

Bumps will pull feature files into the feature directory, run Cukes and then push the results back to the server.
