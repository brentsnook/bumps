--- LATER ---

- add validation for config and some nicer messages?
- get rid of treetop gibberish
- can it be more of a synch than a straight clobber??? for speed mainly
- extract process control logic out into a new gem
- support obtaining details for a single feature ???


--- CHANGES REQUIRED TO CUKES ---

proposal: post-configuration hook and pluggable feature loaders

Hi,

I'd like to propose that a few features be added to Cucumber to make extending it easier.

For my recent gem, Bumps (URL???) I extended Cucumber to load features from a remote server among other things. This involved a spot of dubious metaprogramming and while everything worked fine with 0.3.11, 0.3.96 does not work at all. I knew this would happen sooner or later but I really couldn't see a less brittle approach.

I'd like to suggest some potential changes that would make Cucumber easier to extend (at least in my case)

- make feature loading pluggable
- add a post-configuration hook
- make Cucumber configuration available to the hook

-- Make feature loading pluggable

It would be great if I could plug in my own feature loader class. 

  - can pull in features and then use standard loader
  - could ideally be registered programatically via pre-load hook

-- Add a post-configuration hook

SUGGEST

- make the configuration object available
- make the output stream of the class available
- make feature directory location available


- need to make output stream from class available
- need to register the formatter to collect output
- need to check and set feature directory
- need to perform feature push

- allows things to happen seamlessly
- runs post configuration and then makes configuration available


SHOULD THIS BE ON THE MAILING LIST OR THE ISSUE MGMT SYSTEM???
CHECK THAT THESE THINGS ARE POSSIBLE



CHECK OUT SCRUM FROM HELL
