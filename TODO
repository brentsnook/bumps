--- PULLING FEATURES ---
- implement last verification step, get story fully passing
- use given config file if passed (implement in step too)
- would json be a better choice than xml??? Probably not
- lower cucumber and nokogiri version in pickle bin as much as possible??? (play with versions)
- do we need command line options?
- scenarios to cover multiple directory levels?
- rip off cucumber process handling and see if it works OK


LIMITATIONS

  - takes for granted that the name you give it is a valid path relative to the supplied feature path (SECURITY PROBLEMS???)

--- SERVING STATUS ---
- formatter for simplified format
- need to register a new formatter if loaded after cucumber - how to do it?
- add server to serve status
- add command line script to start server
  - specify report location (defaults)
- post results immediately after run finishes

--- RAKE TASK ---

- add a rake task a la cucumber

--- RELEASE ---

- release gem
- post to wave google group

--- LATER ---

- any way to speed up synching???
- can it be more of a synch than a straight clobber???
- extract process control logic out into a new gem
- support synching a single feature ???
- support obtaining details for a single feature ???
