      include 'pickle'
	
	  Bumps.configure { use_server http://localhost:1726 }
	
  - remove use of pickle.yml
  - add scenarios to cover multiple directory levels?

-- ADD FORMATTER

  - Change configuration to programatically register a new Formatter configured with push address on push_results_to
  - Do you need a new decorator formatter that allows multiple formatters ???

    - Also prints success or failure message
