Feature: Pull remote features

  As a developer
  I want to pull Cucumber features from a remote location
  So that the features can be authored using a separate tool
    
  Scenario: Remote features pulled successfully

    Given that a feature server is running
    When a cucumber run is performed
    Then the feature report will contain all remote features

  Scenario: Feature server not reachable

    Given that a feature server is not running
    When a cucumber run is performed
    Then the feature report should show that the feature server was not available
